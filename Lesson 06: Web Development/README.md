# Lesson 06: Web Development

### Creating New Pages
To create a new web page, you first need to specify the route in the routes.py as well as the name of the html template.
```
@app.route('/new-route')
def render_the_route():
    return render_template('new_route.html')
```
The route name, function name, and template name do not have to match; however, it's good practice to make them similar so that the code is easier to follow.

The new_route.html file must go in the templates folder. Flask automatically looks for html files in the templates folder.
