# Lesson 03: Statistical Considerations in Testing

## Practical Significance
Even if an experiment result shows a statistically significant difference in an
evaluation metric between control and experimental groups, that does not
necessarily mean that the experiment was a success. If there are any costs
associated with deploying a change, those costs might outweigh the benefits
expected based on the experiment results. Practical significance refers to
the level of effect that you need to observe in order for the experiment to be
called a true success and implemented in truth. Not all experiments imply a
practical significance boundary, but it's an important factor in the
interpretation of outcomes where it is relevant.

If you consider the confidence interval for an evaluation metric statistic
against the null baseline and practical significance bound, there are a few
cases that can come about.
