### README Showcase

1. Installation - Extra libraries that are not installed with the Anaconda distribution, as well as what what version of python you are using should be noted.

2. Project Motivation - Discuss what your project is about, and what interested you in pursuing the project.

3.File Descriptions - Guide others through the files in your repository. You may not talk about every file here, but you should let them know where they can find the work they might find most interesting.

4. How To Interact With Your Project - When your project isn't meant to be interactive or used for other projects, you should instead talk about the technical details of your project. What were your results? What did you do to improve them? What methods did you try? What worked? What didn't work?

5.Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements - You always want to give credit where necessary. Acknowledge other contributors, helpful peers, data providers, etc.

You can use this to assist as a template for your own post.

### Useful Commands

From this video, you saw the use of the following commands:

git clone - clone a repository from any url to your local machine

git add * - adds all the files of the repository to the staging area

git commit -m 'comment about changes made' - commits changes and adds a message for changes made

git push - pushes your changes to a remote repository

Recap
You are so ready to take on this project! I hope you are excited to create your own post! There was a lot to take away from this lesson. Here were the big points I had in mind:

Related to Marketing Yourself
Catchy image followed by a catchy title.


Write in small blocks of text, as large blocks of text will exhaust and demotivate your reader.


Start with an engaging question or current event that your audience is likely thinking about.


End with a recap and a call to action.


Related to Keeping Yourself and Your Reader Motivated
Keep your post short and sweet. 1-2 pages per post will increase audience engagement, as well as the likelihood you complete the writing of your post.


Create an outline. A useful outline for your post could just be: introduction, each of your questions, and then a conclusion. This will help you stay focused when writing your post.


Review. Review. Review. When you think you have reviewed enough, find someone else to review. The more review you have of your work, the better it will become.

The three Text portions of this class contain A LOT of useful information. Use them for reference as you complete your project, and as you continue to write more posts in the future!
