### **The CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining)**

The lessons leading up to the first project are about helping you go through CRISP-DM in practice from start to finish. Even when we get into the weeds of coding, try to take a step back and realize what part of the process you are in, and assure that you remember the question you are trying answer and what a solution to that question looks like.

`1.` Business Understanding

`2.` Data Understanding

`3.` Prepare Data

`4.` Data Modeling

`5.` Evaluate the Results

`6.` Deploy

The first two steps of CRISP-DM are:

1. Business Understanding - this means understanding the problem and questions you are interested in tackling in the context of whatever domain you're working in. Examples include

How do we acquire new customers?
Does a new treatment perform better than an existing treatment?
How can improve communication?
How can we improve travel?
How can we better retain information?
2. Data Understanding - at this step, you need to move the questions from Business Understanding to data. You might already have data that could be used to answer the questions, or you might have to collect data to get at your questions of interest.

Business and Data Understanding
Business Questions
How do I break into the field?
What are the placement and salaries of those who attended a coding bootcamp?
How well can we predict an individual's salary? What aspects correlate well to salary?
How well can we predict an individual's job satisfaction? What aspects correlate well to job satisfaction?
Data Understanding
You will be using the Stackoverflow survey data to get some insight into each of these questions. In the rest of the lesson, you can work along with me to answer these questions, or you can take your own approach to see if the conclusions you draw are similar to those you would find throughout this lesson.
